# PrimusCode
**A Simulation Pipeline for Cosmic Ray Paleo-Detectors** 

This repository contains the Python-based analysis framework for the **PRImuS** (Paleo-astroparticles Reconstructed with the Interactions of MUons in Stone) project. The code is designed to perform phenomenological studies on paleo-detectors, specifically by simulating the expected rate of nuclear recoil tracks induced by cosmic ray muons in natural minerals. The **primary scientific application** of this code is detailed in our paper, available on **arXiv**: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04908](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04908)

## The Analysis Workflow
The analysis pipeline is structured around a single Jupyter Notebook (`Primus_analysis.ipynb`) that interacts with a core utility module (`mineral_utils.py`). All parameters for a given analysis run are defined in a central configuration dictionary at the beginning of the notebook. This includes:
 - The mineral to be analyzed (e.g., Halite, Olivine).
 - The geological history of the sample (age, exposure time, deposition rate).
 - The astrophysical scenarios for the cosmic ray flux (e.g., standard flux, enhanced flux from a nearby supernova).

To run this analysis pipeline, you will need a Python environment with the following packages installed. You can install them using `pip`:
```bash
pip install numpy scipy matplotlib mendeleev
```
To run the analysis, clone the Repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/cgalelli/PrimusCode.git
cd PrimusCode
```
